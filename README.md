# BlockPAAS( Blockchain Platform as a Service)

BlockPAAS is a platform as a service on which end users can create a network of blockchain nodes running in selected IoT hardware. Users can choose a blockchain protocol to run on the hardware. The selected devices form a network. End users can deploy smart contracts via Remix onto the platform blockchain nodes and benchmark the performance. The platform also offers various live metrics like RAM, CPU, Power and hundreds of other blockchain metrics.
